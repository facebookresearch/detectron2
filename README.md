Detectron2 is Facebook AI Research's next generation software system
that implements state-of-the-art object detection algorithms.
It is a ground-up rewrite of the previous version,
[Detectron](https://github.com/facebookresearch/Detectron/),
and it originates from [maskrcnn-benchmark](https://github.com/facebookresearch/maskrcnn-benchmark/).
It is written in Python and powered by the [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org) deep
learning framework.
