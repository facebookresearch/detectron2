Detectron2 is Facebook AI Research's next generation library
that provides state-of-the-art detection and segmentation algorithms.
It is the successor of
[Detectron](https://github.com/facebookresearch/Detectron/)
and [maskrcnn-benchmark](https://github.com/facebookresearch/maskrcnn-benchmark/).
It supports a number of computer vision research projects and production applications in Facebook.

## Learn More about Detectron2

* Includes new capabilities such as panoptic segmentation, Densepose, Cascade R-CNN, rotated bounding boxes, PointRend,
  DeepLab, ViTDet, MViTv2 etc.
* Used as a library to support building [research projects](projects/) on top of it.
* Models can be exported to TorchScript format or Caffe2 format for deployment.
* It [trains much faster](https://detectron2.readthedocs.io/notes/benchmarks.html).
