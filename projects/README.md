Here are a few research projects that are built on detectron2.
They are examples of how to use detectron2 as a library, to make your projects more
maintainable.

+ [DensePose: Dense Human Pose Estimation In The Wild](DensePose)
+ [Scale-Aware Trident Networks for Object Detection](TridentNet)
+ [TensorMask: A Foundation for Dense Object Segmentation](TensorMask)
+ Mesh R-CNN.  (Coming Soon)
