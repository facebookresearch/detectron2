Here are a few projects that are built on detectron2.
They are examples of how to use detectron2 as a library, to make your projects more
maintainable.

## External Projects

External projects in the community that use detectron2:

<!--
 - If you want to contribute, note that:
 -  1. please add your project to the list and try to use only one line
 -  2. the project must provide models trained on standard datasets

 Projects are *roughly sorted* by: "score = PaperCitation * 5 + Stars",
 where PaperCitation equals the citation count of the paper, if the project is an *official* implementation of the paper.
 PaperCitation equals 0 otherwise.
