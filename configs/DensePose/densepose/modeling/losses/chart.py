    """
    DensePose loss for chart-based training. A mesh is split into charts,
    each chart is given a label (I) and parametrized by 2 coordinates referred to
    as U and V. Ground truth consists of a number of points annotated with
    I, U and V values and coarse segmentation S defined for all pixels of the
    object bounding box. In some cases (see `COARSE_SEGM_TRAINED_BY_MASKS`),
    semantic segmentation annotations can be used as ground truth inputs as well.

    Estimated values are tensors:
     * U coordinates, tensor of shape [N, C, S, S]
     * V coordinates, tensor of shape [N, C, S, S]
     * fine segmentation estimates, tensor of shape [N, C, S, S] with raw unnormalized
       scores for each fine segmentation label at each location
     * coarse segmentation estimates, tensor of shape [N, D, S, S] with raw unnormalized
       scores for each coarse segmentation label at each location
    where N is the number of detections, C is the number of fine segmentation
    labels, S is the estimate size ( = width = height) and D is the number of
    coarse segmentation channels.

    The losses are:
    * regression (smooth L1) loss for U and V coordinates
    * cross entropy loss for fine (I) and coarse (S) segmentations
    Each loss has an associated weight
